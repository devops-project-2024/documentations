# Infrastructure Setup Documentation for CI/CD Pipeline Project

## Introduction

This document provides detailed instructions for setting up the infrastructure required to support a CI/CD pipeline integrating GitHub, Jenkins, and Argo CD within a Kubernetes environment. It covers the provisioning of cloud resources, network connectivity and security configurations, Jenkins server setup, Argo CD installation and configuration, and Kubernetes cluster configuration.

## Cloud Resources Provisioning

### 1. Cloud Provider Selection

- **Provider Chosen**: [Cloud Provider Name]
- **Rationale**: [Reason for selection based on cost, availability, features, etc.]

### 2. Virtual Machines (VMs) and Kubernetes Nodes

- **Specifications**: [CPU, Memory, Storage]
- **Provisioning Steps**:
  1. Log into the cloud provider portal.
  2. Navigate to the VM or Kubernetes service section.
  3. Create a new instance/node with the specified specifications.
  4. Configure the network settings according to the VPC and subnet requirements.

### 3. Storage and Networking

- **Persistent Storage**: [Size and type for Jenkins and Argo CD]
- **VPC and Subnet Configuration**: [Configuration details]
- **Load Balancers**: [Setup for Jenkins and Argo CD]

## Network Connectivity and Security

### 1. Network ACLs and Firewalls

- **Configuration**:
  - Define inbound and outbound rules to control traffic flow.
  - Ensure only necessary ports are open for Jenkins, Argo CD, and Kubernetes API access.

### 2. IAM Roles and Policies

- **Roles**:
  - [Role for Jenkins]
  - [Role for Argo CD]
- **Policies**:
  - Attach policies that grant necessary permissions for each role.

### 3. TLS Configuration

- **Certificates**:
  - Generate or procure TLS certificates for securing communications.
- **Deployment**:
  - Configure TLS in Jenkins, Argo CD, and Kubernetes ingress controllers.

## Jenkins Server Setup

### 1. Installation

- **Method**: [Docker/VM/Kubernetes Pod]
- **Steps**:
  1. [Step-by-step instructions for the chosen installation method]

### 2. Plugin Configuration

- **Essential Plugins**: [List of Jenkins plugins for GitHub, Kubernetes, and others]
- **Installation Steps**:
  1. Navigate to the 'Manage Plugins' section in Jenkins.
  2. Search for and install the necessary plugins.

### 3. GitHub Integration

- **Webhook Setup**:
  - Instructions for creating a webhook in GitHub to trigger Jenkins builds.

## Argo CD Installation and Configuration

### 1. Argo CD Deployment

- **Installation Steps**:
  1. Apply the Argo CD installation manifests using `kubectl`.
  2. Configure access control and expose the Argo CD UI.

### 2. Application Definitions

- **Creation Steps**:
  - Define applications in Argo CD using declarative YAML files.
  - Configure sync policies for automated deployment.

## Kubernetes Cluster Configuration

### 1. Namespace and Access Control

- **Setup**:
  - Create namespaces for Jenkins and Argo CD.
  - Define roles and role bindings for operational security.

### 2. Monitoring and Logging

- **Prometheus and Grafana**:
  - Deploy Prometheus for metrics collection.
  - Set up Grafana for visualization.
- **Elasticsearch, Fluentd, and Kibana (EFK)**:
  - Deploy the EFK stack for centralized logging.

## Conclusion

This document outlines the detailed steps required to set up the infrastructure for a CI/CD pipeline project. Following these instructions will ensure a secure, efficient, and scalable infrastructure foundation, ready for the implementation of continuous integration and continuous deployment processes. Regular updates and maintenance of the infrastructure setup documentation are recommended to reflect changes and improvements in the setup process and technologies used.
