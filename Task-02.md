# 1.2: Infrastructure Preparation for CI/CD Pipeline Project

## Objective

Prepare the underlying infrastructure to support a CI/CD pipeline utilizing GitHub, Jenkins, and Argo CD in a Kubernetes environment. This includes provisioning cloud resources, configuring network settings, and setting up the necessary services and tools.

## Responsibilities

- **Infrastructure Team**: Leads the effort in provisioning and configuring the required infrastructure.
- **Security Team**: Assists in setting up security measures and ensuring compliance with organizational policies.

## Steps

### 2.1 Cloud Resources Provisioning

1. **Evaluate Requirements**:
   - Determine the computing resources needed for Jenkins, Argo CD, and the Kubernetes cluster(s).
   - Assess storage requirements for applications, artifacts, and logs.

2. **Select Cloud Provider**:
   - Choose a cloud provider (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, Azure) based on cost, availability, and features.
   - Ensure the provider supports Kubernetes and offers scalable options for future growth.

3. **Provision Resources**:
   - Create virtual machines (VMs) or Kubernetes nodes with the required specifications.
   - Allocate persistent storage for Jenkins and Argo CD.
   - Set up networking resources such as VPCs, subnets, and security groups.

### 2.2 Network Connectivity and Security

1. **Configure Network Settings**:
   - Establish VPC peering or VPN connections if resources are spread across multiple networks or cloud providers.
   - Configure load balancers for Jenkins and Argo CD for high availability and redundancy.

2. **Implement Security Measures**:
   - Set up firewalls and network ACLs to control inbound and outbound traffic.
   - Create IAM roles and policies for granular access control to resources.

3. **Secure Communication**:
   - Implement TLS for secure communication between Jenkins, GitHub, Argo CD, and Kubernetes.
   - Use private repositories and secure secrets management for sensitive information.

### 2.3 Jenkins Server Setup

1. **Install Jenkins**:
   - Choose an appropriate method to install Jenkins (e.g., using Docker, VM, Kubernetes pod).
   - Configure Jenkins with necessary plugins for integration with GitHub and Kubernetes.

2. **Configure Integration**:
   - Set up webhooks in GitHub for triggering Jenkins builds on code commits or pull requests.
   - Install and configure the Argo CD plugin or CLI in Jenkins for deploying to Kubernetes.

### 2.4 Argo CD Installation and Configuration

1. **Install Argo CD**:
   - Deploy Argo CD in the Kubernetes cluster following the official documentation.
   - Configure Argo CD to connect to your GitHub repository for application definitions.

2. **Define Applications**:
   - Create application definitions in Argo CD for automated deployment to Kubernetes.
   - Set up deployment strategies (e.g., rolling update, blue-green deployment).

### 2.5 Kubernetes Cluster Configuration

1. **Set Up Cluster**:
   - Configure namespaces, roles, and role bindings for Jenkins and Argo CD.
   - Install necessary Kubernetes operators or CRDs required by applications.

2. **Monitoring and Logging**:
   - Deploy monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana.
   - Set up centralized logging using Fluentd, Elasticsearch, and Kibana.

## Deliverables

- A fully provisioned and configured cloud infrastructure ready for CI/CD pipeline implementation.
- Documented configurations and setup procedures for all components.
- A security report detailing the measures implemented to secure the infrastructure.
