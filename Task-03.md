# 1.3 Define Resource Requirements

## Objective

The goal of this stage is to accurately define the necessary resources to support the CI/CD pipeline infrastructure, ensuring optimal performance and reliability. This encompasses hardware, software, and human resources essential for deploying Jenkins, Argo CD, and a Kubernetes environment, along with monitoring and logging tools.

## Hardware Requirements

### Jenkins Server

- **CPU**: Minimum of 4 cores for small to medium projects; 8 cores or more for larger projects or higher concurrency.
- **Memory**: At least 8 GB RAM; 16 GB or more recommended for larger builds or when running multiple builds simultaneously.
- **Storage**: Minimum of 50 GB for Jenkins installation and workspace. Consider additional space for build artifacts and logs. SSDs recommended for better performance.

### Argo CD

- **CPU**: Minimum of 2 cores; 4 cores recommended for handling large numbers of applications and complex deployments.
- **Memory**: At least 4 GB RAM; 8 GB recommended for managing numerous applications or large deployments.
- **Storage**: 20 GB for Argo CD components and repositories caching. Additional space may be required depending on the size of the repositories and number of applications.

### Kubernetes Cluster

- **Master Nodes**: At least 2 CPU cores and 2 GB RAM for small clusters; for production environments, 4 CPU cores and 8 GB RAM per master node are recommended.
- **Worker Nodes**: Depending on the workload, a minimum of 2 CPU cores and 4 GB RAM; for heavier workloads, 8 CPU cores and 16 GB RAM or more per node.
- **Storage**: Dynamic provisioning with a cloud provider or dedicated storage solution (e.g., Ceph, NFS) for persistent volumes. Capacity depends on the applications' needs.

## Software Requirements

- **Operating System**: Linux distribution (e.g., Ubuntu, CentOS) compatible with Docker and Kubernetes.
- **Container Runtime**: Docker or any OCI-compliant runtime supported by Kubernetes.
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes, latest stable version.
- **CI/CD Tools**: Jenkins, Argo CD (latest stable versions).
- **Version Control System**: Git client for Jenkins integration.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring; Elasticsearch, Fluentd (or Logstash), and Kibana (EFK stack) for logging.

## Human Resources

- **DevOps Engineers**: At least 2 experienced DevOps engineers for initial setup and configuration of Jenkins, Argo CD, and Kubernetes.
- **System Administrators**: 1-2 system administrators for managing the underlying OS and hardware, network configurations, and security aspects.
- **Developers**: Team size varies based on the project scope. Essential for pipeline configuration, test automation, and deployment scripting.
- **Security Specialist**: 1 security specialist for implementing and reviewing security measures across the infrastructure.

## Additional Tools

- **Backup and Recovery Solutions**: Tools for backing up configurations and data related to Jenkins, Argo CD, and Kubernetes.
- **Secret Management**: Solutions like HashiCorp Vault or Kubernetes Secrets for managing sensitive information securely.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Tools like Terraform or Ansible for automating the provisioning and management of infrastructure.
