### Task: CI/CD Pipeline Setup in Kubernetes Development Environment

#### Overview
Our goal is to implement a CI/CD pipeline that integrates with our current development practices. Our source code management system is GitHub, Jenkins will serve as our Continuous Integration (CI) tool, and Argo CD will be used for Continuous Deployment (CD) within our Kubernetes development environment.

#### Team Structure and Responsibilities
The team consists of 8 members. To effectively manage this task, responsibilities will be divided as follows:

1. **Infrastructure Team (2 members)**: This subgroup is responsible for setting up and maintaining the infrastructure required for the CI/CD pipeline. Tasks include provisioning necessary resources within our cloud provider, ensuring connectivity between Jenkins, GitHub, and Argo CD, and setting up the Jenkins server.

2. **Pipeline Team (2 members)**: This team will focus on the CI pipeline in Jenkins and the CD pipeline in Argo CD. Responsibilities include configuring Jenkins to automatically trigger builds on new commits to the main branch in GitHub, writing Jenkinsfile for build and test stages, and setting up Argo CD applications for deploying to Kubernetes.

3. **Kubernetes Administration and Monitoring Team (3 members)**: This group will handle Kubernetes cluster administration, including the setup of namespaces, roles, and permissions for Jenkins and Argo CD. They will also configure monitoring and logging solutions to ensure the health and performance of the environment, utilizing tools like Prometheus and Grafana.

#### Task Execution Plan

1. **Initial Setup and Planning**:
   - Review current infrastructure and identify any additional resources needed.
   - Create a detailed project plan outlining each team's tasks and timelines.

2. **Infrastructure Preparation**:
   - Provision cloud resources and set up network connectivity.
   - Install and configure Jenkins server, ensuring integration with GitHub and Argo CD.

3. **CI/CD Pipeline Configuration**:
   - Pipeline Team sets up Jenkins pipelines, including build, test, and artifact stages.
   - Configure Argo CD for deployment, defining application resources and deployment strategies.

4. **Kubernetes Setup and Monitoring**:
   - Configure Kubernetes clusters, namespaces, and permissions for Jenkins and Argo CD.
   - Implement monitoring and logging solutions, set up dashboards for real-time monitoring.

5. **Testing and Iteration**:
   - Conduct end-to-end tests of the CI/CD pipeline, making adjustments as necessary.
   - Ensure documentation is created for each part of the process for future reference.

6. **Review and Feedback**:
   - Conduct a team review of the implemented pipeline and infrastructure.
   - Gather feedback and make any necessary adjustments.

#### Deliverables

1. A fully functional CI/CD pipeline that integrates GitHub, Jenkins, and Argo CD, deploying applications to a Kubernetes development environment.
2. Documentation covering the setup process, configurations, and how to manage and monitor the environment.
3. Dashboards for monitoring the health and performance of the Kubernetes environment.

#### Timeline

- Estimated completion time: [Specify based on detailed project plan].
